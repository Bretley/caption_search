and now they're throwing out k shaped
 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.429 align:start position:0%
and now they're throwing out k shaped
that's<00:00:29.039><c> bad</c><00:00:29.840><c> okay</c><00:00:30.560><c> if</c><00:00:30.720><c> you're</c><00:00:30.880><c> watching</c><00:00:31.199><c> this</c>

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
that's bad okay if you're watching this
 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.190 align:start position:0%
that's bad okay if you're watching this
that's<00:00:31.679><c> probably</c><00:00:32.000><c> bad</c><00:00:32.239><c> for</c><00:00:32.399><c> you</c>

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
that's probably bad for you
 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.470 align:start position:0%

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
so this isn't a biden talking point
 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.430 align:start position:0%
so this isn't a biden talking point
