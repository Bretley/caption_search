not<00:01:14.909><c> a</c><00:01:14.970><c> good</c><00:01:15.030><c> idea</c><00:01:15.299><c> right</c><00:01:15.780><c> now</c>

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 align:start position:0%
not a good idea right now
 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.490 align:start position:0%
not a good idea right now
keep<00:01:17.970><c> that</c><00:01:18.150><c> in</c><00:01:18.360><c> mind</c><00:01:18.390><c> as</c><00:01:18.960><c> we</c><00:01:19.350><c> talk</c><00:01:19.619><c> about</c><00:01:19.830><c> this</c>
