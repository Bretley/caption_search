00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
the talking point is to bring all
 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.120 align:start position:0%
the talking point is to bring all

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 align:start position:0%
production home and just rely on what we
 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.029 align:start position:0%
production home and just rely on what we

have here in the United States
 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.679 align:start position:0%
have here in the United States
therefore<00:00:23.039><c> we</c><00:00:23.850><c> don't</c><00:00:24.000><c> purchase</c><00:00:24.449><c> anything</c>

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 align:start position:0%
therefore we don't purchase anything
 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.259 align:start position:0%
therefore we don't purchase anything
from<00:00:24.859><c> overseas</c>

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 align:start position:0%

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
therefore our supply chain is more
 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.030 align:start position:0%

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
thought experiment right now the reason
we're<00:01:07.530><c> having</c><00:01:07.650><c> trouble</c><00:01:08.070><c> getting</c><00:01:08.159><c> supplies</c><00:01:08.520><c> is</c>

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 align:start position:0%
we're having trouble getting supplies is
 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.899 align:start position:0%
we're having trouble getting supplies is

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 align:start position:0%
because it's a global problem and
 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.890 align:start position:0%
because it's a global problem and
facilities<00:01:14.909><c> all</c><00:01:15.180><c> over</c><00:01:15.360><c> the</c><00:01:15.450><c> world</c><00:01:15.630><c> have</c><00:01:15.780><c> been</c>

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
and and that's one of the reasons that
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
and and that's one of the reasons that

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 align:start position:0%
we'll get to that that's the reason it's
 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.249 align:start position:0%
