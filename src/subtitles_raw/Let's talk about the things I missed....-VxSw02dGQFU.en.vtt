can't get tested that's me um maybe
maybe<00:15:33.300><c> that</c><00:15:33.869><c> it</c><00:15:34.050><c> that</c><00:15:34.199><c> it's</c><00:15:34.379><c> a</c><00:15:34.559><c> very</c><00:15:34.949><c> distinct</c>

00:15:35.359 --> 00:15:35.369 align:start position:0%
maybe that it that it's a very distinct

possibility I don't I think it's pretty
likely<00:15:40.079><c> I</c><00:15:40.499><c> think</c><00:15:40.980><c> that</c><00:15:41.249><c> if</c><00:15:42.119><c> it</c><00:15:42.389><c> does</c><00:15:42.600><c> get</c><00:15:42.869><c> bad</c>

00:15:43.449 --> 00:15:43.459 align:start position:0%
likely I think that if it does get bad
