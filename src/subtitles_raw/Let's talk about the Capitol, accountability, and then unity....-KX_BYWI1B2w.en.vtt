everybody is uh just pretending as if
they<00:00:23.840><c> had</c><00:00:24.000><c> nothing</c><00:00:24.320><c> to</c><00:00:24.400><c> do</c><00:00:24.640><c> with</c><00:00:24.800><c> it</c>

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
they had nothing to do with it
 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.990 align:start position:0%
they had nothing to do with it
and<00:00:26.720><c> that</c><00:00:26.880><c> makes</c><00:00:27.199><c> it</c><00:00:27.279><c> hard</c><00:00:27.519><c> to</c><00:00:27.599><c> believe</c><00:00:27.920><c> that</c>

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
and that makes it hard to believe that
 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.109 align:start position:0%
and that makes it hard to believe that
there's<00:00:28.240><c> going</c><00:00:28.400><c> to</c><00:00:28.480><c> be</c><00:00:28.640><c> any</c><00:00:28.880><c> accountability</c>

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
there's going to be any accountability
 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.310 align:start position:0%
there's going to be any accountability
so<00:00:31.439><c> let's</c><00:00:31.760><c> take</c><00:00:32.000><c> stock</c><00:00:33.360><c> of</c><00:00:33.680><c> the</c><00:00:33.920><c> type</c><00:00:34.160><c> of</c>

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
so let's take stock of the type of
 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.990 align:start position:0%
so let's take stock of the type of

so<00:00:36.320><c> far</c><00:00:37.440><c> and</c><00:00:37.680><c> what</c><00:00:37.920><c> is</c><00:00:38.079><c> planned</c>

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
so far and what is planned
 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.990 align:start position:0%
so far and what is planned
okay<00:00:41.360><c> so</c><00:00:42.320><c> we</c><00:00:42.480><c> talked</c><00:00:42.719><c> about</c><00:00:42.960><c> how</c><00:00:43.200><c> the</c><00:00:43.360><c> strategy</c>

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
okay so we talked about how the strategy
 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.630 align:start position:0%
