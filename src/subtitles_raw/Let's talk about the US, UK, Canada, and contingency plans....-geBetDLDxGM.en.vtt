00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 align:start position:0%
so we couldn't really deal with it
 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.760 align:start position:0%

to invade Canada the thought behind it
 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.190 align:start position:0%
to invade Canada the thought behind it
was<00:02:48.160><c> that</c><00:02:48.400><c> was</c><00:02:48.580><c> how</c><00:02:48.790><c> the</c><00:02:49.450><c> United</c><00:02:49.780><c> Kingdom</c><00:02:50.080><c> will</c>

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 align:start position:0%
was that was how the United Kingdom will
 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.750 align:start position:0%
was that was how the United Kingdom will
respond<00:02:50.590><c> they</c><00:02:50.800><c> would</c><00:02:50.950><c> move</c><00:02:51.070><c> troops</c><00:02:51.310><c> there</c><00:02:51.640><c> and</c>

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
respond they would move troops there and
 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
respond they would move troops there and
then<00:02:51.880><c> South</c><00:02:52.230><c> so</c><00:02:53.230><c> we</c><00:02:53.620><c> were</c><00:02:53.739><c> just</c><00:02:53.770><c> going</c><00:02:53.980><c> to</c><00:02:54.040><c> take</c>

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 align:start position:0%
then South so we were just going to take
 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.590 align:start position:0%
then South so we were just going to take
it<00:02:54.280><c> over</c><00:02:55.320><c> with</c><00:02:56.320><c> specific</c><00:02:57.220><c> attention</c><00:02:58.000><c> paid</c><00:02:58.570><c> to</c>

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 align:start position:0%
it over with specific attention paid to
 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.420 align:start position:0%
it over with specific attention paid to
Halifax<00:02:59.310><c> because</c><00:03:00.310><c> that's</c><00:03:00.550><c> the</c><00:03:00.850><c> port</c><00:03:01.180><c> that</c><00:03:01.450><c> was</c>

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 align:start position:0%
Halifax because that's the port that was
 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.650 align:start position:0%
Halifax because that's the port that was
imagined<00:03:03.430><c> they</c><00:03:03.850><c> would</c><00:03:03.970><c> use</c><00:03:04.209><c> to</c><00:03:04.239><c> bring</c><00:03:04.510><c> in</c>

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 align:start position:0%
