00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
so I just have a completely different
 

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.420 align:start position:0%
so I just have a completely different

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
work and it may not but I I do find that
 

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.300 align:start position:0%
work and it may not but I I do find that
it<00:24:45.000><c> resonates</c><00:24:45.450><c> and</c><00:24:45.630><c> I</c><00:24:45.810><c> do</c><00:24:45.870><c> feel</c><00:24:46.620><c> better</c><00:24:46.950><c> about</c>

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:47.310 align:start position:0%
it resonates and I do feel better about

still think overall the best approach
would<00:29:31.929><c> be</c><00:29:31.960><c> to</c><00:29:32.110><c> just</c><00:29:32.230><c> pay</c><00:29:32.470><c> people</c><00:29:32.500><c> a</c><00:29:32.890><c> living</c>

00:29:32.909 --> 00:29:32.919 align:start position:0%
would be to just pay people a living
 

00:29:32.919 --> 00:29:36.750 align:start position:0%
would be to just pay people a living

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
wage so you would then that their
 

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
