i mean we have to consider that a pretty

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 align:start position:0%

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
to start lashing out
 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.150 align:start position:0%
to start lashing out
it's<00:04:44.560><c> what</c><00:04:44.880><c> all</c><00:04:45.199><c> people</c><00:04:45.600><c> like</c><00:04:45.919><c> this</c><00:04:46.400><c> do</c>

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.270 align:start position:0%
