00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 align:start position:0%
other reasoning behind it is that if
 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.700 align:start position:0%
other reasoning behind it is that if
yeah<00:01:06.210><c> maybe</c><00:01:06.510><c> there</c><00:01:06.689><c> are</c><00:01:06.810><c> some</c><00:01:07.020><c> good</c><00:01:07.200><c> cops</c><00:01:07.500><c> out</c>

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe there are some good cops out
 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.990 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe there are some good cops out
there<00:01:07.950><c> but</c><00:01:08.130><c> if</c><00:01:08.220><c> they</c><00:01:08.310><c> don't</c><00:01:08.490><c> say</c><00:01:08.700><c> anything</c>

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
there but if they don't say anything
 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.820 align:start position:0%
there but if they don't say anything
about<00:01:09.090><c> the</c><00:01:09.299><c> bad</c><00:01:09.479><c> cops</c><00:01:09.780><c> they're</c><00:01:10.439><c> complicit</c>

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 align:start position:0%
about the bad cops they're complicit
 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.370 align:start position:0%
about the bad cops they're complicit
therefore<00:01:11.640><c> they're</c><00:01:11.850><c> bad</c><00:01:12.060><c> we</c><00:01:12.750><c> don't</c><00:01:12.990><c> have</c><00:01:13.229><c> many</c>

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
