so if if yours is a little different
 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.469 align:start position:0%
so if if yours is a little different
that's<00:06:25.840><c> why</c>

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
that's why
 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:29.510 align:start position:0%
that's why
this<00:06:26.720><c> happened</c><00:06:28.400><c> 15</c><00:06:28.720><c> years</c><00:06:28.960><c> ago</c>

this happened 15 years ago
 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.070 align:start position:0%
this happened 15 years ago
so<00:06:29.759><c> if</c><00:06:29.919><c> you've</c><00:06:30.000><c> got</c><00:06:30.160><c> one</c><00:06:30.319><c> of</c><00:06:30.400><c> the</c><00:06:30.560><c> older</c><00:06:30.960><c> ones</c>

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
so if you've got one of the older ones
 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.990 align:start position:0%
so if you've got one of the older ones
you<00:06:32.400><c> may</c><00:06:32.560><c> not</c><00:06:32.800><c> have</c><00:06:33.120><c> five</c><00:06:33.360><c> elements</c><00:06:33.680><c> you</c><00:06:33.759><c> may</c>

you may not have five elements you may

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.390 align:start position:0%

i<00:06:41.199><c> think</c><00:06:41.360><c> they</c><00:06:41.520><c> have</c><00:06:41.600><c> different</c><00:06:41.919><c> terms</c><00:06:42.240><c> for</c>

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
i think they have different terms for
 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.230 align:start position:0%
i think they have different terms for
