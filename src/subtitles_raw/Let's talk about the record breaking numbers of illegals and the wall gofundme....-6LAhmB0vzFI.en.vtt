so what border patrol has used for
 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.310 align:start position:0%
so what border patrol has used for

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
kind of extrapolate from that
 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.830 align:start position:0%
kind of extrapolate from that
now<00:00:40.079><c> there's</c><00:00:40.320><c> a</c><00:00:40.399><c> flaw</c><00:00:40.719><c> in</c><00:00:40.800><c> the</c><00:00:40.879><c> methodology</c>

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
now there's a flaw in the methodology
 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.270 align:start position:0%
now there's a flaw in the methodology
like<00:00:42.079><c> if</c><00:00:42.160><c> you're</c><00:00:42.320><c> comparing</c><00:00:42.719><c> numbers</c><00:00:43.040><c> from</c>

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
like if you're comparing numbers from
 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.470 align:start position:0%
like if you're comparing numbers from
today<00:00:44.320><c> to</c><00:00:44.480><c> 40</c><00:00:44.879><c> years</c><00:00:45.200><c> ago</c>

i<00:00:46.559><c> mean</c><00:00:46.800><c> obviously</c><00:00:47.360><c> there's</c><00:00:47.600><c> more</c><00:00:47.840><c> technology</c>

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
i mean obviously there's more technology
 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.630 align:start position:0%
i mean obviously there's more technology
today<00:00:49.280><c> it's</c><00:00:49.440><c> easier</c><00:00:49.760><c> to</c><00:00:49.920><c> catch</c><00:00:50.160><c> them</c><00:00:50.239><c> today</c>

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
today it's easier to catch them today
 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.069 align:start position:0%
today it's easier to catch them today
they're<00:00:50.800><c> catching</c><00:00:51.120><c> a</c><00:00:51.199><c> higher</c><00:00:51.520><c> percentage</c>

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
they're catching a higher percentage
 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.110 align:start position:0%
they're catching a higher percentage
today

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
today
 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.950 align:start position:0%
today
but<00:00:53.280><c> let's</c><00:00:53.520><c> just</c><00:00:53.760><c> set</c><00:00:53.920><c> that</c><00:00:54.160><c> aside</c><00:00:54.719><c> let's</c>

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
but let's just set that aside let's
 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.510 align:start position:0%
but let's just set that aside let's
forget<00:00:55.280><c> about</c><00:00:55.520><c> that</c><00:00:55.680><c> for</c><00:00:55.840><c> a</c><00:00:55.920><c> second</c>

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
forget about that for a second
 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.950 align:start position:0%
forget about that for a second
because<00:00:58.719><c> the</c><00:00:58.960><c> uh</c>

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
