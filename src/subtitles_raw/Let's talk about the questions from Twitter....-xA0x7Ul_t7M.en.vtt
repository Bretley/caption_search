00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 align:start position:0%
turn into that i think it would be a
 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.350 align:start position:0%
turn into that i think it would be a

and<00:04:39.600><c> i</c><00:04:39.680><c> think</c><00:04:39.840><c> the</c><00:04:40.000><c> response</c><00:04:41.360><c> would</c><00:04:41.600><c> be</c><00:04:41.840><c> pretty</c>

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
and i think the response would be pretty
 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.590 align:start position:0%
and i think the response would be pretty
