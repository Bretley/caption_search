00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
before you that's my first advice but it
 

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.180 align:start position:0%
before you that's my first advice but it
just<00:07:54.360><c> resonated</c><00:07:54.870><c> and</c><00:07:55.200><c> what</c><00:07:55.800><c> yoga</c><00:07:56.160><c> is</c>

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:56.190 align:start position:0%
just resonated and what yoga is
 

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
just resonated and what yoga is
essentially<00:07:56.820><c> is</c><00:07:56.970><c> it's</c><00:07:57.150><c> a</c><00:07:57.240><c> moving</c><00:07:57.570><c> meditation</c>

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:57.690 align:start position:0%
essentially is it's a moving meditation
 

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.450 align:start position:0%
essentially is it's a moving meditation
