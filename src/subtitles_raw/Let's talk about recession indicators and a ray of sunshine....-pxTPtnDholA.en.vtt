so<00:01:12.030><c> if</c><00:01:12.090><c> you</c><00:01:12.180><c> see</c><00:01:12.330><c> the</c><00:01:12.450><c> price</c><00:01:12.720><c> following</c><00:01:13.260><c> that</c>

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
so if you see the price following that
 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.830 align:start position:0%
so if you see the price following that
means<00:01:13.710><c> demand</c><00:01:14.100><c> is</c><00:01:14.340><c> falling</c><00:01:14.810><c> which</c><00:01:15.810><c> means</c>

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
means demand is falling which means
 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.170 align:start position:0%
means demand is falling which means
there's<00:01:16.590><c> less</c><00:01:16.650><c> construction</c><00:01:18.979><c> okay</c><00:01:20.009><c> so</c><00:01:20.759><c> all</c>

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
there's less construction okay so all
 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
there's less construction okay so all
that's<00:01:21.420><c> happened</c><00:01:21.930><c> so</c><00:01:22.320><c> when</c><00:01:22.530><c> that</c><00:01:22.650><c> happened</c><00:01:23.100><c> I</c>
