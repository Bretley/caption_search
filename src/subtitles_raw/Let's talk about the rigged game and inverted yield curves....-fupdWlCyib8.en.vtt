again so tonight we're going to talk
 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.849 align:start position:0%
again so tonight we're going to talk
about<00:00:05.759><c> the</c><00:00:05.940><c> inverted</c><00:00:06.420><c> yield</c><00:00:06.660><c> curve</c><00:00:06.859><c> again</c>

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 align:start position:0%
about the inverted yield curve again
 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.650 align:start position:0%
about the inverted yield curve again
we've<00:00:08.610><c> talked</c><00:00:08.820><c> about</c><00:00:08.910><c> it</c><00:00:09.090><c> before</c><00:00:09.150><c> so</c><00:00:09.510><c> we're</c>

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
we've talked about it before so we're
 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.180 align:start position:0%
we've talked about it before so we're
just<00:00:09.690><c> gonna</c><00:00:09.870><c> do</c><00:00:09.990><c> a</c><00:00:10.050><c> real</c><00:00:10.260><c> simple</c><00:00:10.530><c> explanation</c>

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 align:start position:0%
just gonna do a real simple explanation
 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.289 align:start position:0%
just gonna do a real simple explanation
and<00:00:11.370><c> then</c><00:00:11.969><c> move</c><00:00:12.179><c> on</c><00:00:13.460><c> okay</c><00:00:14.460><c> an</c><00:00:14.639><c> inverted</c><00:00:15.120><c> yield</c>

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 align:start position:0%
and then move on okay an inverted yield
 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.849 align:start position:0%
and then move on okay an inverted yield
curve<00:00:15.450><c> when</c><00:00:15.839><c> people</c><00:00:16.109><c> say</c><00:00:16.289><c> that</c><00:00:16.500><c> what</c><00:00:16.710><c> they</c>

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 align:start position:0%
back you would figure you should get
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
back you would figure you should get
more<00:00:42.840><c> for</c><00:00:43.620><c> giving</c><00:00:43.829><c> it</c><00:00:43.920><c> tuned</c><00:00:44.100><c> for</c><00:00:44.340><c> ten</c><00:00:44.550><c> years</c>

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 align:start position:0%
more for giving it tuned for ten years
 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.209 align:start position:0%
more for giving it tuned for ten years
then<00:00:45.809><c> you</c><00:00:46.079><c> would</c><00:00:46.289><c> forgiving</c><00:00:46.800><c> it</c><00:00:46.920><c> to</c><00:00:47.010><c> them</c><00:00:47.100><c> for</c>

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 align:start position:0%
then you would forgiving it to them for
 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.750 align:start position:0%
then you would forgiving it to them for
three<00:00:47.460><c> months</c><00:00:47.870><c> it</c><00:00:48.870><c> makes</c><00:00:49.170><c> complete</c><00:00:49.440><c> sense</c><00:00:49.760><c> it</c>

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
three months it makes complete sense it
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
three months it makes complete sense it
sounds<00:00:51.090><c> weird</c><00:00:51.270><c> but</c><00:00:51.360><c> it</c><00:00:51.600><c> makes</c><00:00:51.629><c> sense</c><00:00:53.930><c> what</c>

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 align:start position:0%
sounds weird but it makes sense what
 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.470 align:start position:0%
sounds weird but it makes sense what
that<00:00:55.110><c> means</c><00:00:55.350><c> when</c><00:00:55.649><c> that</c><00:00:55.680><c> happens</c><00:00:56.280><c> is</c><00:00:56.550><c> that</c>

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
that means when that happens is that
 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
that means when that happens is that
investors<00:00:58.020><c> have</c><00:00:58.079><c> a</c><00:00:58.320><c> shaky</c><00:00:58.980><c> outlook</c><00:00:59.460><c> on</c><00:00:59.699><c> the</c>
