that's<00:06:49.199><c> how</c><00:06:49.360><c> it</c><00:06:49.440><c> works</c>

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's how it works
 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.150 align:start position:0%
that's how it works
there<00:06:50.639><c> has</c><00:06:50.880><c> to</c><00:06:50.960><c> be</c><00:06:51.120><c> the</c><00:06:51.280><c> element</c><00:06:51.919><c> of</c>

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:55.990 align:start position:0%

so<00:06:53.840><c> it</c><00:06:54.000><c> can't</c><00:06:54.319><c> appear</c><00:06:54.720><c> planned</c><00:06:55.520><c> if</c><00:06:55.680><c> it</c><00:06:55.840><c> went</c>

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
so it can't appear planned if it went
 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.830 align:start position:0%
so it can't appear planned if it went
down<00:06:56.319><c> right</c><00:06:56.479><c> now</c><00:06:56.800><c> it</c><00:06:56.960><c> would</c><00:06:57.120><c> certainly</c><00:06:57.520><c> appear</c>

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:02.870 align:start position:0%

so<00:07:00.880><c> that's</c><00:07:01.199><c> how</c><00:07:01.680><c> he</c><00:07:01.919><c> doesn't</c><00:07:02.240><c> have</c><00:07:02.400><c> that</c>

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
so that's how he doesn't have that
 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.309 align:start position:0%
so that's how he doesn't have that
and<00:07:02.960><c> then</c><00:07:03.120><c> you</c><00:07:03.199><c> need</c><00:07:03.440><c> violence</c><00:07:03.759><c> of</c><00:07:03.919><c> action</c>

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%

and then you need violence of action
